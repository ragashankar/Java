String s1, s2;
String s3 = "yes", s4 = "no";
Four String variables were declared: s1, s2, s3, and s4. You can declare many variables
in the same declaration as long as they are all of the same type.

int i1,i2,i3=0; // 3 var are declared and only one is initialized

Another way the exam could try to trick you is to show you code like this line:
int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE



To make sure you understand this, see if you can fi gure out which of the following are
legal declarations. “Legal,” “valid,” and “compiles” are all synonyms in the Java exam
world. We try to use all the terminology you could encounter on the exam.
boolean b1, b2; // legal
String s1 = "1", s2; // valid
double d1, double d2; // Not legal, since double data type for more than one var cannot be typed in the same line
int i1; int i2; // Legal, since sep by (;)
int i3; i4; // Not compile since i4 is not declared with a data type
