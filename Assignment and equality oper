The comparisons for equality are limited to these three cases, so you cannot mix and
match types. For example, each of the following would result in a compiler error:
boolean x = true == 3; // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean y = false != "Giraffe"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean z = 3 == "Kangaroo"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
Pay close attention to the data types when you see an equality operator on the exam.
The exam creators also have a habit of mixing assignment operators and equality operators,
as in the following snippet:
boolean y = false;
boolean x = (y = true);
System.out.println(x); // Outputs true
