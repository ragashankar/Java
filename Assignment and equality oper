The comparisons for equality are limited to these three cases, so you cannot mix and
match types. For example, each of the following would result in a compiler error:
boolean x = true == 3; // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean y = false != "Giraffe"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean z = 3 == "Kangaroo"; // DOES NOT COMPILE
Pay close attention to the data types when you see an equality operator on the exam.
The exam creators also have a habit of mixing assignment operators and equality operators,
as in the following snippet:
boolean y = false;
boolean x = (y = true);
System.out.println(x); // Outputs true

For object comparison, the equality operator is applied to the references to the objects,
not the objects they point to. Two references are equal if and only if they point to the same
object, or both point to null. Letâ€™s take a look at some examples:
File x = new File("myFile.txt");
File y = new File("myFile.txt");
File z = x;
System.out.println(x == y); // Outputs false
System.out.println(x == z); // Outputs true
