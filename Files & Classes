You need to know one more thing about class structure for the OCA exam: multiple
classes can be defi ned in the same fi le, but only one of them is allowed to be public. The
public class matches the name of the fi le. For example, these two classes must be in a fi le
named Meerkat.java:
1: public class Meerkat { }
2: class Paw { }
A fi le is also allowed to have neither class be public. As long as there isn’t more than
one public class in a fi le, it is okay. On the OCP exam, you’ll also need to understand inner
classes, which are classes within a class.
