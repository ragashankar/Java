Switch case:
int dayOfWeek = 5;
switch(dayOfWeek) {
default:
System.out.println("Weekday");
break;
case 0:
System.out.println("Sunday");
break;
case 6:
System.out.println("Saturday");
break;
}
With a value of dayOfWeek of 5, this code will output:
Weekday

int dayOfWeek = 5;
switch(dayOfWeek) {
case 0:
System.out.println("Sunday");
default:
System.out.println("Weekday");
case 6:
System.out.println("Saturday");
break;
}

This code looks a lot like the previous example except two of the break statements have
been removed and the order has been changed. This means that for the given value of day-
OfWeek, 5, the code will jump to the default block and then execute all of the proceeding
case statements in order until it fi nds a break statement or fi nishes the structure:
Weekday
Saturday









private int getSortOrder(String firstName, final String lastName) {
String middleName = "Patricia";
final String suffix = "JR";
int id = 0;
switch(firstName) {
case "Test":
return 52;
76 Chapter 2 ■ Operators and Statements
case middleName: // DOES NOT COMPILE
id = 5;
break;
case suffix:
id = 0;
break;
case lastName: // DOES NOT COMPILE
id = 8;
break;
case 5: // DOES NOT COMPILE
id = 7;
break;
case 'J': // DOES NOT COMPILE
id = 10;
break;
case java.time.DayOfWeek.SUNDAY: // DOES NOT COMPILE
id=15;
break;
}
return id;
}
The fi rst case statement compiles without issue using a String literal and is a good
example of how a return statement, like a break statement, can be used to exit the switch
statement early. The second case statement does not compile because middleName is not a
final variable, despite having a known value at this particular line of execution. The third
case statement compiles without issue because suffix is a final constant variable.
In the fourth case statement, despite lastName being final, it is not constant as it is
passed to the function; therefore, this line does not compile as well. Finally, the last three
case statements don’t compile because none of them have a matching type of String; the
last one is an enum value.
